# French Defence

## 1.e4 e6

The French Defence starts with the moves: `1. e4 e6`

```chess

### 2.d4 d5

Typically whites next move is `2 d4` taking central space. Black can respond with d5 attacking e4.

```chess

| pl| pl| pl|   |   | pl| pl| pl

moves 1.e4 e3 2.d4 d5
```

White can now respond in a few ways:

* `3. Nc3` Defending the e4 pawn, and putting pressure on the d4 pawn
* `3. Nd2` Safe but less aggressive knight move
* `3. e5` Advance Variation
* `3. exd5` Exchange Variation

Among many others

### 3. Nc3

White defends the e4 pawn, and puts pressure on the d4 pawn with `3. Nc3`

moves 1.e4 e3 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3
```

#### 3... Bb4 Winawer Variation

Black can continue with `3... Bb4` which pins the knight on c3, forcing White to resolve the central tension.

```

##### 4. e5 Winawer, Advance Variation

White normally clarifies the central situation for the moment by advancing with `4. e5`, gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced.

| rl| nl| bl| kl| ql| bl|   | rl

| rd| nd|   | kd| qd| bd| nd| rd
moves 1.e4 e3 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4. e4
```

The main line then is: `4... c5`

And continues `5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3.`

##### 4. exd5 Winawer, Delayed Exchange Variation

White could instead resolve the tension with `4. exd5`

```

### 3. Nd2 Tarrasch Variation

The Tarrasch Variation is named after Siegbert Tarrasch. This move became particularly popular during the 1970s and early 1980s when Anatoly Karpov used it to great effect. Though less aggressive than the alternate `3.Nc3`, it is still used by top-level players seeking a small, safe advantage.

Like `3.Nc3`, `3.Nd2` protects e4, but is different in several key respects: it does not block White's c-pawn from advancing, which means he can play c3 at some point to support his d4-pawn. Hence, it avoids the Winawer Variation as `3...Bb4` is now readily answered by `4.c3`. On the other hand, `3.Nd2` develops the knight to an arguably less active square than `3.Nc3`, and in addition, it hems in White's dark-square bishop. Hence, White will typically have to spend an extra tempo moving the knight from d2 at some point before developing said bishop.

```chess

| rd| nd| bd| kd| qd| bd| nd| rd
moves 1.e4 e3 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3
```

Black can answer with `5... c5` inviting an exchange in order to activate the dark square bishop.
